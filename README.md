## Dataset Description:
- The dataset pertains to industrial copper production and includes various attributes related to copper mining, refining, and utilization.
- It comprises both numerical and categorical variables, such as production volume, copper grade, mining location, refining method, etc.
- Key variables include copper production volume (tons), ore grade, refining techniques, geographical location of mines, etc.
## Data Cleaning:
- Identified and addressed missing values, ensuring data integrity and completeness.
- Conducted data type conversion and normalization to ensure consistency across columns.
- Removed redundant or irrelevant features that did not contribute to the modeling objectives.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyzed the distribution of copper production volumes to understand its variability and trends over time.
- Explored relationships between key variables such as ore grade, refining method, and production volume.
- Investigated geographical patterns of copper mining and production.
## Feature Engineering:
- Converted categorical variables into numerical representations using encoding techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- created new features if necessary, such as calculating the average ore grade per mining location or refining technique.
## Modeling:
- Developed predictive models to forecast industrial copper production volumes.
- Considered regression techniques suitable for continuous target variables, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, etc.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE), R-squared, and mean absolute error (MAE).
## Model Selection and Tuning:
- Selected the best-performing model based on cross-validated performance metrics.
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters of the selected model to optimize predictive accuracy and generalization.
## Predictions:
- Utilized the trained model to make predictions on future or unseen data.
- Demonstrated the process of saving and loading the trained model for practical deployment or further analysis.
- The analysis aimed to provide insights into industrial copper production dynamics and develop accurate models for forecasting future production volumes, facilitating informed decision-making in the copper industry.
